# freeCodeCamp-Machine-Learning-with-Python-Projects
A repository that contains the five projects I completed for my freeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python certification.

I built the following projects and got all automated test suites to pass:

1. Rock Paper Scissors: I created a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against 4 different bots and beat them atleast 60% of the time.
2. Cat and Dog Image Classifier: I used Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs.
3. Book Recommendation Engine using KNN: I created a book recommendation algorithm that uses K-Nearest Neighbors from scikit-learn. When a book title is inputed it returns the books that are most similar to it.
4. Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator: I predicted healthcare costs using regression model. The regression model was built with a Keras Dense Neural Network with a normalization layer, two dense layers and a final output layer.
5. Neural Network SMS Text Classifier: I created a machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam". A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.
